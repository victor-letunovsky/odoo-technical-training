# Odoo 16.0 - Technical Training

The Technical Training of Odoo 16.0 is available on the
[Tutorial](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/howtos/rdtraining.html) or [Getting started](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/tutorials/getting_started.html)

[Developer Mode](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/applications/general/developer_mode.html)

# A New Application

1. The model is defined in the file `estate/models/estate_property.py`
2. The file `estate_property.py` is imported in `estate/models/__init__.py`
3. The folder `models` is imported in `estate/__init__.py`

## Manifest
Our [manifest](estate/__manifest__.py).

Describes module:
- name
- category
- summary
- website
- dependencies (on other modules)
- etc...

Prepare the addon directory. [manifest](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/module.html#reference-module-manifest) \

Example of manifest: [CRM file](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/fc92728fb2aa306bf0e01a7f9ae1cfa3c1df0e10/addons/crm/__manifest__.py)

# Object-Relational Mapping
[ORM API](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html)

## Models

Model fields are defined as attributes on the model itself:
```python
from odoo import models, fields
class AModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'a.model.name'

    field1 = fields.Char()
```
> **Warning** \
> You cannot define a field and a method with the same name, the last one will silently overwrite the former ones.

By default, the fieldâ€™s label (user-visible name) is a capitalized version of the field name, this can be overridden with the string parameter:
```python
from odoo import fields
field2 = fields.Integer(string="Field Label")
```

Default value:
```python
from odoo import fields
name = fields.Char(default="a value")
```

Default value as a compute function:
```python
from odoo import fields

def _default_name(self):
    return self.get_value()

name = fields.Char(default=lambda self: self._default_name())
```

# Security
Odoo provides a security mechanism to allow access to the data for specific groups of users.

Details: [Restrict access to data](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/tutorials/restrict_data_access.html)

## Data Files (CSV)
For example [list of country states](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/odoo/addons/base/data/res.country.state.csv)
which is loaded at installation of the `base` module.
```csv
"id","country_id:id","name","code"
state_au_1,au,"Australian Capital Territory","ACT"
state_au_2,au,"New South Wales","NSW"
state_au_3,au,"Northern Territory","NT"
state_au_4,au,"Queensland","QLD"
...
```
These three fields are [defined](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/2ad2f3d6567b6266fc42c6d2999d11f3066b282c/odoo/addons/base/models/res_country.py#L108-L111)
in `res.country.state` model.

Data folders:
* `data` contains a file importing data
* `security` - data related to security
* `views` - data related to views and actions

All of these files must be declared in the `data` section within the `__manifest__.py` file.
For example `res.country.state.csv` is defined in
[the manifest of the base module](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/e8697f609372cd61b045c4ee2c7f0fcfb496f58a/odoo/addons/base/__manifest__.py#L29).

The content of the data files is only loaded when a module is installed or updated.

> **Warning** \
> The data files are sequentially loaded following their order in the `__manifest__.py` file.
> This means that if data `A` refers to data `B`, you must make sure that `B` is loaded before `A`.

## Access Rights
Documentation: [Access Rights](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/security.html#reference-security-acl)

Access rights are records of model `ir.model.access` and usually defined in a CSV file named `security/ir.model.access.csv`.
Example of [base access rights model](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/odoo/addons/base/security/ir.model.access.csv).

Each access right is associated with:
1. model
2. group
3. set of permissions

Set of permissions:
1. create
2. read
3. write
4. unlink (equivalent of `delete`)

`model_id/id` refers to the model which the access right applies to. The standard way to refer to the model is
`model_<model_name>`, where `<model_name>` is the `_name` of the model with the `.` replaced by `_`. Seems cumbersome?
Indeed, it is...

# UI

## Data Files
Documentation: [Data Files](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/data.html#reference-data)

XML is an alternative to CSV format of data files. When performance is important, the CSV format is preferred over the XML format.
When the format is complex (e.g. load the structure of a view or an email template), XML format is used.

When the data is linked to views, we add them to the `views` folder.

Actions and menus are standard records in the database loaded through an XML file.

In Odoo, the user interface (actions, menus and views) is largely defined by creating and composing records defined in
an XML file.
A common pattern is Menu > Action > View.
To access records the user navigates through several menu levels; the deepest level is an action which triggers the opening of a list of the records.

## Actions
Documentation: [Actions](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/actions.html#reference-actions)

Actions can be triggered in three ways:
1. by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
2. by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
3. as contextual actions on object

Example of action for `test_model`:
```xml
<record id="test_model_action" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Test action</field>
    <field name="res_model">test_model</field>
    <field name="view_mode">tree,form</field>
</record>
```

Good example of [simple action](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/09c59012bf80d2ccbafe21c39e604d6cfda72924/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L57-L70) in Odoo.

## Menus
Documentation: [Shortcuts](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/data.html#reference-data-shortcuts)

`<menuitem>` is a shortcut to `ir.ui.menu` record to reduce complexity in declaring a menu and connecting it to the corresponding action.

A basic menu for our `test_model_action` is:
```xml
<!-- The menu `test_model_menu_action` is linked to the action `test_model_action`,
    and the action is linked to the model `test_model`. -->
<menuitem id="test_model_menu_action" action="test_model_action"/>
```

The action here is link between the menu and the model (`menu -> action -> model`).

There are three levels of menus:
1. The root menu, displayed in App switcher
2. The first level menu, displayed in the top bar
3. The action menus

For example:
```xml
<menuitem id="test_menu_root" name="Test">
    <menuitem id="test_first_level_menu" name="First Level">
        <menuitem id="test_model_menu_action" action="test_model_action"/>
    </menuitem>
</menuitem>
```

## Fields, Attributes And View
Documentation: [Fields](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#fields)

Some examples of the view fine-tunings:
* some fields have a default value
* some fields are read-only
* some fields are not copied when duplicating the record

## Reserved Fields
Documentation: [Reserved Field names](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#reference-orm-fields-reserved)

A few field names are reserved for pre-defined behavior.
They should be defined on a model when the related behavior is desired:
* `name`
* `active` - toggles the global visibility of the record
* `state` - lifecycle stages of the object (used by `fields.states` attribute)
* `parent_id` - used to organize records in a tree structure
* `parent_path`
* `company_id` - used for Odoo multi-company behavior

# Basic Views
Documentation: [Views](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/views.html)

In practice, the default view (from previous chapter [UI](#UI)) is **never** acceptable for a business application.

Views are defined as `ir.ui.view` model in XML with actions and menus.

In our real estate module we need following views customizations:
* in the list view we need more fields than just the name.
* in the form view the fields should be grouped.
* in the search view search on more fields than just the name.

Basic views structure (placeholders - in caps):
```xml
<record id="MODEL_view_TYPE" model="ir.ui.view">
  <field name="name">NAME</field>
  <field name="model">MODEL</field>
  <field name="arch" type="xml">
    <VIEW_TYPE>
      <VIEW_SPECIFICATIONS/>
    </VIEW_TYPE>
  </field>
</record>
```

## List
Documentation: [List](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/views.html#reference-views-list)

List views root element is `<tree>`.

The most basic version of this view simply lists all the fields to display in the table (where each field is a column):
```xml
<tree string="Tests">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="last_seen"/>
</tree>
```

## Form
Documentation: [Form](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/views.html#reference-views-form)

Root element is `<form>` and its XML is composed of:
1. high-level structure elements (groups and notebooks)
2. interactive elements (buttons and fields)

For example:
```xml
<form string="Test">
    <sheet>
        <group>
            <group>
                <field name="name"/>
            </group>
            <group>
                <field name="last_seen"/>
            </group>
            <notebook>
                <page string="Description">
                    <field name="description"/>
                </page>
            </notebook>
        </group>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

It is possible to use regular HTML tags such as `div` and `h1` as well as the `class` attribute (Odoo provides some built-in classes) to fine-tune the look.

[A simple example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6da14a3aadeb3efc40f145f6c11fc33314b2f15e/addons/crm/views/crm_lost_reason_views.xml#L16-L44)

## Search
Documentation: [Search](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/views.html#reference-views-search)

Root element is `<search>`, its most basic version lists necessary fields:
```xml
<search string="Tests">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="last_seen"/>
</search>
```

Search views can also contain `<filter>` elements, which act as toggles for predefined searches.
Filters must have one of the following attributes:
* `domain`: adds the given domain to the current search
* `context`: adds some context to the current search; uses the key `group_by` to group results on the given field name

[A simple example](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/715a24333bf000d5d98b9ede5155d3af32de067c/addons/delivery/views/delivery_view.xml#L30-L44)

## Domains
Documentation: [Search domains](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#reference-orm-domains)

Domain encodes conditions on records. Domain is a list of criteria used to select a subset of a modelâ€™s records.

Each criterion is a triplet with a _field name_, an _operator_ and a _value_.

Example one:
```javascript
[('product_type', '=', 'service'), ('unit_price', '>', 1000)]
```

Example two:
```javascript
['|',
    ('product_type', '=', 'service'),
    '!', '&',
        ('unit_price', '>=', 1000),
        ('unit_price', '<', 2000)]
```

> **Notes** \
> XML does not allow `<` and `&` to be used inside XML elements. \
> To avoid parsing errors, entity references should be used:
> * `&lt;` for `<`
> * `&amp;` for `&`
> * `&gt;` for `>`
> * `&apos;` for `'`
> * `&quot;` for `"`

# Relations Between Models

## Many2one
Documentation: [Many2one](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2one)

A `many2one` is a simple link to another object.
For example, in order to define a link to the `res.partner` in our test model, we can write:
```python
from odoo import fields
partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
```

By convention, `many2one` fields have the `_id` suffix. Accessing the data in the partner can then be easily done with:

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
print(my_test_object.partner_id.name)
```

> **See also** \
> [foreign keys](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-fk.html)

> **Note** \
> The object `self.env` gives access to request parameters and other useful things:
> * `self.env.cr` or `self._cr` is the database _cursor_ object; it is used for querying the database
> * `self.env.uid` or `self._uid` is the current userâ€™s database id
> * `self.env.user` is the current userâ€™s record
> * `self.env.context` or `self._context` is the context dictionary
> * `self.env.ref(xml_id)` returns the record corresponding to an XML id
> * `self.env[model_name]` returns an instance of the given model

## Many2many
Documentation: [Many2many](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#odoo.fields.Many2many)

A `many2many` is a bidirectional multiple relationship: any record on one side can be related to any number of records
on the other side.
For example, to define a link to the `account.tax` model on our test model:
```python
from odoo import fields
tax_ids = fields.Many2many("account.tax", string="Taxes")
```

By convention, `many2many` fields have the `_ids` suffix. Accessing the data must be done in a loop:

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
for tax in my_test_object.tax_ids:
    print(tax.name)
```

A list of records is known as a _recordset_, i.e. an ordered collection of records.
It supports standard Python operations on collections, such as `len()` and `iter()`,
plus extra set operations like `recs1 | recs2`.
